# NeuroSim

## Overview

NeuroSim is a full-stack web platform that allows users to simulate, visualize, and analyze
interactions between brain regions under various cognitive conditions (e.g., stress, fatigue,
focus).

It integrates deep learning, neuro-symbolic AI, dense vector search, and quantum-assisted
processing to offer:
	• Real-time cognitive state prediction via deep learning models.
	• Retrieval of past brain states using FAISS-based similarity search.
	• Explainable AI (XAI) through neuro-symbolic AI and transformers.
	• Scalable deployment via Docker, Kubernetes and/or AWS.

## Features

• Cognitive State Simulation: Predict how brain regions interact under different conditions.
• Real-Time Insights: AI-driven natural language explanations for cognitive processes.
• Neuro-Symbolic AI: Combines deep learning with symbolic reasoning for explainability.
• FAISS-Based Retrieval: Quickly find and compare past cognitive states.
• Cloud-Scalable Deployment: Runs efficiently on AWS or on-premise with Docker/Kubernetes.

6. Principles of Neuroscience and Cognitive Science:
	• (Some) Theories to inform brain simulation:
		• Connectionist Models of Cognition:
			• 'The brain operates via distributed representations across
			  neuron-like units.'
		• Giulio Tonomi's Integrated Information Theory (IIT):
			• 'Consciousness to be quantified based on how much a system
			  integrates information across its parts.'
		• Embodied Cognition:
			• 'Cognition is deeply linked to bodily states and environmental
			  interactions.'
		• Bernard Baars' Global Workspace Theory (GWT):
			• 'Consciousness arises from the brain's ability to globally
			  share information across different regions.'
		• Daniel Kahneman's Dual Process Theory:
			• 'Two modes of thinking: System 1: (Fast, Intuitive, Emotional),
			  System 2: (Slow, Analytical, Logical)'
		• Neural Oscillations & Synchronization:
			• 'Different cognitive states (e.g., sleep, focused attention,
			  creativity) correspond to different oscillation frequencies
			  in the brain.'
		• Karl Friston's Predictive Coding & Free Energy Principle:
			• 'The brain is thought to minimize prediction errors by constantly
			  updating internal models of the world.'
		• Quantum Decision Theory:
			• 'Human decision-making better explained with quantum probability
			  rather than classical probability.'
		• Penrose & Hameroff's Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR):
			• 'Quantumm processes in microtubules contribute to consciousness.'

## Project Workflow

Phase 1: Brain Interaction Models:
	• Research and collect open datasets (e.g., Human Connectome Project, OpenfMRI).
	• Preprocess the data (e.g., normalize, handle missing values).
	• Train ML models to predict activity between brain regions.

Phase 2: Simulation Engine:
	• Develop a backend service to run brain interaction simulations based on user inputs.
	• Integrate ML models into the simulation engine.
	• Implement quantum optimization for simulation parameters.

Phase 3: Web Application:
	• Build a full-stack web application with features for:
		• Defining simulation parameters (e.g., brain activity under stress).
		• Visualizing results in real-time.
	• Focus on a clean and intuitive user interface.

Phase 4: Deployment:
	• Deploy the application to a cloud platform.
	• User containerization (e.g., Docker) to ensure portability.
	• Set up CI/CD pipelines for regular updates.

## Example Workflow for User

1. User selects a scenario (e.g., "How does multitasking affect brain activity?").
2. The user inputs parameters (e.g., attention span, hours of sleep, etc).
3. The backend runs the simulation using ML models and quantum optimization.
4. Display a 3D visualization of the brain with real-time activity patterns and provide
   insights.
