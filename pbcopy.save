# NeuroSim TODO ## âœ… Completed - [x] Verified that backend `/api/state/{state_name}` is 
functioning correctly - [x] Confirmed frontend `App.jsx` fetches state data and passes it 
to diagram components - [x] Established and documented the expected JSON format 
(`regions` + `ai_modules`) - [x] Created 29 example cognitive state `.json` files using a 
utility script - [x] Implemented `generate_cognitive_states.py` to automate state data 
creation - [x] Fixed logic in `<BrainDiagram>` and `<AISystemDiagram>` components to 
correctly render incoming data - [x] Added graceful handling for loading states or 
invalid state data (e.g. fallback text) - [x] Integrated `StateSelector` dropdown with 
the full list of cognitive states - [x] Defined long-term visual layout plan (brain: 
lateral/medial; AI: 5-fold representation) - [x] Scaffolded `BrainDiagram/` 
subcomponents: `LateralView`, `MedialView`, and wrapper - [x] Scaffolded 
`AISystemDiagram/` with five placeholder components for alternate visual representations 
- [x] Repaired and verified correct frontend file layout (`index.html`, `main.jsx`) - [x] 
Confirmed frontend renders selector and loading UI in default state - [x] Updated 
`App.jsx` to conditionally render brain and AI components only when data is loaded - [x] 
Confirmed `LateralView.jsx` and `MedialView.jsx` mount without errors - [x] Began 
debugging live data rendering paths using console logging ## ðŸ”§ In Progress - [ ] Ensure 
region name strings from JSON align with frontend `regionPositions` mapping - [ ] Confirm 
final shape and content of incoming JSON (e.g. `stress.json`) - [ ] Replace placeholder 
SVGs with meaningful, data-driven render logic (AI + brain) - [ ] Define interactivity 
design pattern (e.g. hover â†’ tooltip, click â†’ detail view) ## ðŸ”œ Next Steps - [ ] 
Implement dynamic region rendering in `LateralView.jsx` (visual anatomy + activation) - [ 
] Implement dynamic region rendering in `MedialView.jsx` - [ ] Validate `.json` input 
parsing and region matching across all states - [ ] Animate transitions between cognitive 
states (e.g. fading, color morph, motion) - [ ] Add metadata descriptions to each 
cognitive state (for UI tooltips or detail panels) - [ ] Optionally expose `/api/states` 
endpoint to dynamically list cognitive states - [ ] Add responsive layout wrapper for 
brain vs. AI system side-by-side presentation - [ ] Centralize color logic (e.g. 
`getFillColor()`) into a shared utility module --- **Current Status**: Frontend and 
backend are synchronized and stable. Cognitive state data is loading correctly. Diagrams 
are mounted but not yet rendering meaningful region/module visuals from live data. 
Immediate focus is on verifying JSON compatibility and enabling base-level SVG-driven 
displays before introducing interactivity or animations.
